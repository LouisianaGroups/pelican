## Development

To hack on Pelican you‚Äôll need [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.github.io/) version 1.4.x. With that
in place, install the project dependencies:

```sh
$ mix deps.get
```

Now you‚Äôre ready to fire up a local web server (the project will need to compile the first time
you do this):

```sh
$ mix phx.server
```

Happy hacking!

## Roadmap

- [ ] 85% or higher test coverage
- [ ] Continuous integration for testing and linting
